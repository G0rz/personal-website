The main goal was to project Pablo's identity, integrating his original literary and photographic material to consolidate his personal brand in the digital ecosystem.",
        "w2": "A high-impact visual landing page was developed specifically to function as a dynamic portfolio. The platform not only exposes his musical work interactively but acts as a repository of his artistic vision. Technically, I implemented Next.js to ensure optimal performance and Tailwind CSS along with cutting-edge libraries like React Bits and HeroUI to achieve a modern and attractive interface.",
        "w3": "The need stemmed from the lack of a centralized digital presence that would allow Pablo to formally establish himself as an artist. The challenge was twofold: achieving impeccable technical SEO so that his name is easily searchable, and resolving the aesthetic complexity of a design that had to be, at the same time, sober, minimalist, and modern.",
        "w4": "The application is deployed on Firebase infrastructure, using a subdomain managed in Squarespace. For real-time data management, I integrated Cloud Firestore, allowing the contact form to function as an immediate feedback channel where user opinions are reflected in the database instantly.",
        "w5": "The project was carried out through an iterative design process. After presenting two conceptual proposals and maintaining constant communication with the client, we managed to define the correct visual hierarchy. Development focused on applying Next.js best practices for organic positioning, culminating in a successful deployment that meets all requested technical and brand requirements."
